# MNIST Ridge Regression Classification
This repository contains the code for a Ridge Regression classification model applied to the MNIST dataset. It was developed as an assignment for the Data Tidying and Reporting course in the MSc in Statistics for Data Science program at UC3M.

## Overview
In this assignment, we aim to perform classification on the MNIST dataset using Ridge Regression. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the digit given an image.

## Files
Task1.Rmd: This R Markdown file contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and reporting. It includes explanations, code chunks, and visualizations.
Task1.pdf: The rendered pdf file from the R Markdown document, providing a formatted version of the code, results, and visualizations.
qmnist_nist.RData: This file contains the MNIST dataset files.

## Instructions
To replicate the results or explore the code:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.
Open Task1.Rmd in RStudio.
Install any required packages mentioned in the R Markdown file.
Follow the instructions in the R Markdown file to execute each code chunk sequentially.

## Results
The main findings and results of the classification task are summarized in the R Markdown document. This includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy and visualizations of the results.
